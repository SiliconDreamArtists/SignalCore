# üßæ SovereignTrust PowerShell Core Review Summary

**Objective:** Confirm foundational suitability of uploaded PowerShell components for SovereignTrust execution and memory protocol.

## üì¶ Core Classes

### 1. `Graph.ps1`
Defines the sovereign memory structure.
- Supports recursive pointer graphs
- Logs and signals tracked execution state
- Key methods: `RegisterSignal()`, `Finalize()`, `SignalUnresolvedStatus()`

### 2. `Signal.ps1`
Encapsulates all execution state, memory result, and mutation log.
- Standard fields: `.Result`, `.Pointer`, `.Entries`, `.Jacket`
- Merging and escalation logic provided
- Sovereign mutation via `.SetResult()` and `.MergeSignalAndVerifyFailure()`

### 3. `SignalEntry.ps1`
Handles log entries for each Signal event.
- Encapsulates type, severity, timestamp, source, and message
- Enables lineage traceability and mutation auditing

## üîç Resolution Utilities

### 4. `Resolve-PathFromDictionary.ps1`
Canonical read function for memory-safe graph traversal.
- Prevents raw access
- Supports nested graph/Signal pointer dereferencing
- Compliant with sovereign memory doctrine

### 5. `Add-PathToDictionary.ps1`
Canonical write function for all state mutation.
- Requires signal-traceable structure
- Prevents direct hash updates
- Central to ceremonial mutation

## üß™ Specialized Resolver

### 6. `Resolve-PathFormulaGraphForJsonArray.ps1`
Orchestrates formula-based array graph construction.
- Parses `WirePath` mappings
- Invokes recursive resolve logic for complex Condenser operations

---

## ‚úÖ Verdict

All uploaded components align tightly with:
- Section 1: Signal-Based Execution
- Section 3: Memory Sovereignty
- Section 5: Conduction Is Ceremony
- Constant-001: Protocol Is Recursion

These are confirmed as **valid core primitives** of the SovereignTrust execution layer.
